	<h2 class="h">My Dream Vacation</h2>
	<p>My dream vacation would be to go to japan and explore. I would go and walk around tokyo see all the cool and weird technology they have. after a few days there I would take a trip to Mt. Fuji and try to hike up the mountain if it is nice out. after those two main points of interest i would just take a look at all of the smaller cities around the vrbo I am staying at. Maybe make a trip to universal studios japan which is located in osaka.</p>
